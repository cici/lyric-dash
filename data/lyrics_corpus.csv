Brandi Carlile,The Joke,"By the Way, I Forgive You",2017,"You're feeling nervous, aren't you, boy?
With your quiet voice and impeccable style
Don't ever let them steal your joy
And your gentle ways, to keep 'em from running wild
They can kick dirt in your face
Dress you down, and tell you that your place
Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine
I see you tugging on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts

Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them

You get discouraged, don't you, girl?
It's your brother's world for a while longer
You gotta dance with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt in your face
To call you weak and then displace you
After carrying your baby on your back across the desert
I saw your eyes behind your hair
And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared

Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them"
Brandi Carlile,The Story,The Story,2007,"All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am

But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true
I was made for you

I climbed across the mountaintops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
But baby I broke them all for you

Oh, because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks
You do
I was made for you


You see the smile that's on my mouth
It's hiding the words that don't come out
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed
They don't know my head is a mess

No they don't know who I really am
And they don't know what I've been through
Like you do
And I was made for you

All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am

Oh but these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true
I was made for you

Oh yeah, well it's true
That I was made for you"
Brandi Carlile,Every Time I Hear That Song,"By the Way, I Forgive You",2018,"A love song was playing on the radio
It made me kind of sad because it made me think of you
And I wonder how you're doing but I wish I didn't care
Because I gave you all I had and got the worst of you

By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)

Didn't it break your heart when you watched my smile fading
Did it ever cross your mind that one day the tables would be turned
They told me the best revenge would be a life well lived
And the strongest one that holds would be the hardest one to earn

By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Oh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)

When I woke up in the morning I was choking on some words
There were things unsaid between us, there were things you never told
Now that's twice you broke my heart now, the first was way back when
And to know you're still unhappy only makes it break again

By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
By the way, I forgive you
I never will, never will forget you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Oh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Oh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Ooh, ooh, hmm"
Brandi Carlile,Hold Out Your Hand,"By the Way, I Forgive You",2018,"I run a lot of miles of life and crime
And mountain climbs and quittin' times
Packing that load of lyin' rhymes
And tired jokes and wooden dimes
I've been everybody's friend, everybody's friend

I could lose my house, I could steal a car
I could serve two masters, living hard
Living like a dog in a cage in a yard
With a fist full of cold hard cash that I can't let go
The devil can't have my soul, the devil can't get your soul
The devil can't get your soul

Hold out your hand
Take hold of mine and then
Round and round we go
Don't you wanna dance
I'm a dying man
From the moment we began
Hold out your hand
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da

When the man comes around and the trumpet sounds
And his number calls and the moment he falls
In the haunted halls of man he will understand
He will comprehend, he will not pretend
He will not pretend

When the rain don't fall and the river don't run
And the wind takes orders from the blazing sun
The devil don't break for the fiery snake
And you've had about as goddamn much as you can take
The devil don't take a break, the devil don't take a break
The devil don't take no break

Hold out your hand
Take hold of mine and then
Round and round we go
Don't you wanna dance
I'm a dying man
From the moment we began
Hold out your hand
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da

Well he came to my door to sell me the fear
With some cameras and bullets and tension and
Here is a license for killing your own native son
For a careless mistake and a fake plastic gun?
(Come on!)
Deliver your brother from violence and greed
For the mountains, lay down for your faith like a seed
A morning is coming of silver and light
There will be color and language and nobody wanting to fight
What a glorious sight!
What a glorious sight!
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da

Hold out your hand (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Take hold of mine and then  (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Round and round we go  (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Don't you wanna dance  (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
I'm a dying man  (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
From the moment we began (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Hold out your hand  (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da

Brandi Carlile,Party Of One,"By the Way, I Forgive You",2018,"Waiter send this to the table, the party of one
The only other lonely soul in this place
And so you're finishing up your coffee
But then where're you gonna run?
Where'd you get that look on your face?
You should always let the sun go down on your anger
Let it burn you to sleep
Bring it closer to danger
To surrender and retreat
Sing your sad soul to sleep
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
But I am tired
And I am yours
Don't even think about your freedom or taking that flight
Or going back upon your promise after fighting for the right
Because your eggshells and your ""I"" statements and your weaponized words
Are paper tigers now
Oh your constant overthinking and your secretive drinking
Are making you more and more alone
And girl, you can slam the door behind you, it ain't never gonna close
Because when you're home, you're already home
I am tired
I am tired
I don't wanna go home anymore
I don't wanna throw stones anymore
I don't wanna take part in the war
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I don't wanna be right anymore
Lord, I don't wanna fight anymore
I'm not taking your side anymore
I am tired
I am not my own
And I am leaving
Oh, I am tired
But I'm coming home
'Cause I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours
I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours"
Brandi Carlile,The Mother,"By the Way, I Forgive You",2017,"Welcome to the end of being alone inside your mind
You're tethered to another and you're worried all the time
You always knew the melody but you never heard it rhyme
She's fair and she is quiet, Lord, she doesn't look like me
She made me love the morning, she's a holiday at sea
The New York streets are as busy as they always used to be
But I am the mother of Evangeline

The first things that she took from me were selfishness and sleep
She broke a thousand heirlooms I was never meant to keep
She filled my life with color, canceled plans, and trashed my car
But none of that was ever who we are
Outside of my windows are the mountains and the snow
I hold you while you're sleeping and I wish that I could go
All my rowdy friends are out accomplishing their dreams
But I am the mother of Evangeline

And they've still got their morning paper and their coffee and their time
And they still enjoy their evenings with the skeptics and the wine
Oh, but all the wonders I have seen, I will see a second time
From inside of the ages through your eyes

You are not an accident where no one thought it through
The world has stood against us, made us mean to fight for you
And when we chose your name we knew that you'd fight the power too
You're nothing short of magical and beautiful to me
Oh, I'll never hit the big time without you
So they can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine
'Cause I am the mother of Evangeline

They can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine
'Cause I am the mother of Evangeline
Ooh, ooh
Ooh"
Brandi Carlile,Whatever You Do,"By the Way, I Forgive You",2018,"If I don't owe you a favor, you don't know me
I don't believe we've ever even met
If there's a God in heaven, you can show me
Then I guess I should admit I lost the bet
There are moments I could hold you forever
And there are moments that lasted way too long
There are days when I change with the weather
To hold you in place would be wrong

There's a road left behind me that I'd rather not speak of
And a hard one ahead of me, too
I love you, whatever you do
But I got a life to live, too

I never met a morning I could get through
With nothing on my breath to hold the night
And I never said I'm sorry, but I meant to
I never met a coward I don't like
There are reasons why a body stays in motion
But at the moment, only demons come to mind
There are days when I could walk into the ocean
With no one else but you to leave behind

There's a road left behind me that I'd rather not speak of
And a hard one ahead of me, too
I love you, whatever you do
But I got a life to live, too
There's a road left behind me that I'd rather not speak of
And a hard one ahead of me, too
I love you, whatever you do
But I got a life to live, too"
Brandi Carlile,Most Of All,"By the Way, I Forgive You",2018,"I haven't seen my father in some time
But his face is always staring back at me
His heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms
And my colors change like the sea

But I don't worry much about time lost
I'm not gunning for the dreams I couldn't find
'Cause he taught me how to walk the best that I can
On the road I've left behind

But most of all
He taught me to forgive
How to keep a cool head
How to love the one you're with
And when I'm far into the distance
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love

I haven't heard my mother's voice in a while
But her words are always falling out my mouth
My mind and spirit are at odds sometimes
And they fight like the north and the south

But I still care enough to bear the weight
Of the heaviness to which my heart is tethered
She taught me how to be strong and say goodbye
And that love is forever

But most of all
She taught me how to fight
How to move across the line
Between the wrong and the right
And when I'm turned out in the darkness
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love
Give your love away
Oh, give your love away
And remember what comes back to you
Give your love away
Oh, give your love away
And remember what comes back to you

I haven't seen my father in some time
But his face is always staring back at me
His heavy hands swing at the ends of my arms
And my colors change like the sea"
Brandi Carlile,Carried Me With You,Onward (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),2020,"You're the soul who understands
The scars that made me who I am
Through the drifting sands of time
I got your back and you got mine

If you bear a heavy load
I'll be your wheels, I'll be the road
I'll see us through the thick and thin
For love and loss until the end

'Cause you carried me with you
From the highest of the peaks
To the darkness of the blue
I was just too blind to see
Like a lighthouse in a storm
You were always guiding me
Yeah, it's true
You carried me with you

From the day it all began
Yeah, you were there, you took my hand
And when I hurt a bit too deep
You watched me as I fell asleep

And when my head was in the clouds
You found a way to pull me out
You picked my heart up off the ground
And it showed me love was all around

Yeah, you carried me with you
From the highest of the peaks
To the darkness of the blue
I was just too blind to see
Like a lighthouse in a storm
You were always guiding me
Yeah, it's true
You carried me with you

Oh, we'll be sittin' on the world together (Ooh-ooh)
Watchin' as the days turn into night (Ooh-ooh)
We know how to brave the stormy weather (Ooh-ooh)
And we're never givin' up without a fight

If you should ever bear a heavy load
I'll be your wheels, I'll be the road
I'll see us through the thick and thin
For love and loss until the end

'Cause you carried me with you
From the highest of the peaks
To the darkness of the blue

Brandi Carlile,Sugartooth,"By the Way, I Forgive You",2018,"He wasn't really known for breaking the rules
When he arrived in the second year of my high school
He wasn't so much of a twist of fate
As a short turn up from a Southern state
He was born with a sweet tooth he couldn't beat
Always trying to find himself something sweet
All that he found was a trouble and me
Or maybe trouble just found him

It was hard to hide that his heart had scars
He would stay up late talking to the stars
People tried to blame him for making bad choices
When he was only listening to the voices
And searching for some kind of deeper truth
Between the lines and the Bible and living proof
There's no point now to judge him in vain
If you haven't been there, you don't know the pain

He was a liar, but not a fraud
Living proof that there was no God
Just the Devil, stiff as a rod
A slave to a sugartooth

His life became more than he could take
He found a bad habit he couldn't break
Nothing could tame him and nothing could hold him
He only took the pills when the doctor told him
Looking to help for the something sweet
To make his life feel less incomplete
What in the hell are you gonna do
When the world has made its mind up about you?

He was a liar, but not a fraud
Living proof that there was no God
Just the Devil, stiff as a rod
A slave to a sugartooth

He wanted to be a better man
Then life kicked him down like an old tin can
He would give you the shirt on his back
If not for a sugartooth

They found him lying on his bed
With a gun in his hand and a quiet head
His broken heart, now, is finally gone
But I know that he had to hurt for too long
To think he had fought it all on his own
Just to lose the battle and die alone
After so many years of feeling the loss
He finally made his way back home

And I heard they put what was left in a box
And took it to a place called Jesus Rock
And scattered him all over jagged mound
As a symbol to all that the peace had been found
But not for a sign is left behind
With a hand stuck reaching back in time
To a place in which you can never unwind
I hope he found something so sweet

He was a liar, but not a fraud
Living proof that there was no God
Just the Devil, stiff as a rod
A slave to a sugartooth

He wanted to be a better man
But life kicked him down like an old tin can
He would give you the shirt on his back
If not for a sugartooth

Ooh, ooh, ooh, a slave to a sugartooth
Ooh, ooh, ooh, a slave to a sugartooth
Ooh, ooh, ooh, a slave to a sugartooth
Ooh, ooh, ooh, a slave to a sugartooth"
Brandi Carlile,Heart’s Content,Bear Creek,2012,"Maybe you thought I hung the moon
Maybe you thought we were Johnny and June
Maybe we thought it was just us two
Maybe we spoke too soon

We never lie and we don't tell tales
We bite our tongues and our fingernails
We fall in love and we don't fall out
Maybe we speak too soon

Here's to you and me, and in between
We draw a line but we can't see where it's been
We scratch our heads and race against the heart's content
Oh oh oh oh yeah

Maybe we hurt who we love the most
Maybe it's all we can stand
Maybe we walk through the world as ghosts
Break my own heart before you can

Here's to you and me, and in between
We draw a line but we can't see where it's been
We scratch our heads and race against the heart's content
Oh oh oh oh yeah

Maybe we know how the story ends
Maybe it's not even about us
We both retreat to opposing stands
And the love lives on without us

One thing I know for sure is
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

Here's to you and me, and in between
We draw a line but we can't see where it's been
We scratch our heads and race against the heart's content
Oh oh oh oh, you and me
Oh oh oh oh, you and me
Oh oh oh oh, you and me
Oh oh oh oh yeah"
Brandi Carlile,Hiding My Heart,The Story,2007,"This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away and blew me away
It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

You dropped me off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of my head
Watched me wave, you watched me wave
Then you went on home to your skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That you call home, you call it home

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

I woke up feeling heavy hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And although I wish that you were near
The same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away"
Brandi Carlile,Harder To Forgive,"By the Way, I Forgive You",2018,"I love the songs I hated when I was young
Because they take me back where I come from
When every broken heart seemed like the end
When everyone was someone different then

But I can't be alone in a crowded room
Where my thoughts, they run like water down a flume
There are days when I will let the darkness rise
I don't always choose to stay on the sunny side

Sometimes I pretend we never met (ooh)
Because it's harder to forgive than to forget
Sometimes it's harder to forgive

Yes, my life has seen some wasted time
I have suffered for the peace inside my mind
And some things are better left unsaid
While some things work out different when they're in your head

But I'm not sorry for the things I say
Sometimes I let my mouth just run away
And I believe that all souls are born kind
And that all love lost comes back in time

Sometimes I pretend we never met (ooh)
Because it's harder to forgive than to forget
Sometimes it's harder to forgive

And even if the world is really round
And all the maps are printed upside down
So if you stand in one place for too long
Everything around you will be gone

Well, I'm not gonna miss you when I'm gone
Now the part of me that's left wants you to know
That I'm not gonna jump towards the light
The ones who believe choose the night

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah"
Brandi Carlile,The Eye,The Firewatcher’s Daughter,2014,"It really breaks my heart
To see a dear old friend
Go down to the worn out place again
Do you know the sound
Of a closing door?
Have you heard that sound somewhere before?
Do you wonder if she knows you anymore?

I wrapped your love around me like a chain
But I never was afraid that it would die
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye

Where did you learn to walk?
Where did you learn to run
Away from everything you love?
Did you think the bottle
Would ever ease your pain?
Did you think that love's a foolish game?
Did you find someone else to take the blame?

I wrapped your love around me like a chain
But I never was afraid that it would die
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye

I am a sturdy soul
And there ain't no shame
In lying down in the bed you made
Can you fight the urge to run for another day?
You might make it further if you learn to stay

I wrapped your love around me like a chain
But I never was afraid that it would die
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye"
Brandi Carlile,Raise Hell,Bear Creek,2012,"I've been down with a broken heart
Since the day I learned to speak
The devil gave me a crooked start
When he gave me crooked feet
But Gabriel done came to me
And kissed me in my sleep
And I'll be singing like an angel
Until I'm six feet deep
I found myself an omen and I tattooed on a sign
I set my mind to wandering and I walk a broken line
You have a mind to keep me quiet
And although you can try
Better men have hit their knees
And bigger men have died

I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
You came upon a lightning strike
And eyes of bright clear blue
I took that tie from around my neck
And gave my heart to you
I sent my love across the sea
And though I didn't cry
That voice will haunt my every dream
Until the day I die

I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
I dug a hole inside my heart
To put you in your grave
At this point it was you or me
And mama didn't raise no slave
You took my face in both your hands
And looked me in the eye
And I went down with such a force
That in your grave I lie

I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one's telling
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell"

Out in the middle of nowhere
With nothing much else to do
Oh, the night brought us together
And I lent my heart to you

Maybe you were running way from something
Without so much as a plan
Not a living soul to guide you
Jesus tattooed on your hand

God, the whole world's gone crazy
And there's only God to blame
Somebody called you something sweet once
It was more than Fulton County Jane

And when my heart has no rest
And a thousand things are on my mind
I'll always save some room for you
I won't let you get left behind

Oh, and I always will remember
When the lonely day is through
That somewhere far from Fulton County
A stranger says a prayer for you

God, the whole world's gone crazy
And there's only God to blame
Your mother calls you something sweet once
It was more than Fulton County Jane
Fulton County Jane

We came into this life with nothing
And all we're taking is a name
That's why I've written you this song
This is for Fulton County Jane

God, the whole world's gone crazy
And there's only God to blame
Your mother calls you something sweet once, darling
You're more than Fulton County, Fulton County Jane

Brandi Carlile,Turpentine,The Story,2007,"I watch you grow away from me in photographs
And memories like spies
And salt betrays my eyes again
I started losing sleep and gaining weight
And wishing I was was ten again
So I could be your friend again
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up
I heard you found some pretty words to say
You found your little game to play
And there's no one allowed in
Then just when we believe we could be great
Reality it permeates
And conquers from within again
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up
I know we're growing....
I know we're OK
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up"
Brandi Carlile,I Belong to You,The Firewatcher’s Daughter,2015,"Last night I had the exact same dream as you
I killed a bird to save your life
And you gave me your shoes
You said, ""Clip my wings and walk my miles.""
And I said I would too
Then I woke up but I wasn't gonna tell you

Today I sang the same damn tune as you
It was ""Lady in Red"", I hate that song
And I know you do too
You didn't catch me singin' along
But I always sing with you
Nice and quietly 'cause I don't want to stop you

I know I could be spending a little too much time with you
But time and too much don't belong together like we do
If I had all my yesterdays I'd give 'em to you too
I belong to you now
I belong to you

I see the world the exact same way that you do
We lend our hands and take our stance
In tandem when we do
But I lied and said I knew the way
I hid my eyes from you
I still don't know why, I probably didn't want to scare you

I know I could be spending too much time with you
But time and too much don't belong together like we do
If I had all my yesterdays I'd give 'em to you too
I belong to you now
I belong to you

I'm gonna die the exact same day as you
On the Golden Gate Bridge, I'll hold your hand
And howl at the moon
Scrape the sky with tired eyes
And I will come find you
And I ain't scared, 'cause I'm never gonna miss you

I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now

To be wrong all along and admit it, is not amazing grace
But to be loved like a song you remember
Even when you've changed
Tell me, did I go on a tangent?
Did I lie through my teeth?
Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?
Did I bring shame on my family?
Did it show when I was weak?
Whatever you've seen, that wasn't me
That wasn't me, oh that wasn't me
When you're lost you will toss every lucky coin you'll ever trust
And you'll hide from your God like he ever turns his back on us
And you will fall all the way to the bottom and land on your own knife
And you'll learn who you are even if it doesn't take your life
Tell me, did I go on a tangent?
Did I lie through my teeth?
Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?
Did I bring shame on my family?
Did it show when I was weak?
Whatever you've seen, that wasn't me
That wasn't me, oh that wasn't me
But I want you to know that you'll never be alone
I wanna believe, do I make myself a blessing to everyone I meet
When you fall I will get you on your feet
Do I spend time with my family?
Did it show when I was weak?
When that's what you've seen, that will be me
That will be me, that will be me
That will be me"
Brandi Carlile,That Year,Give Up The Ghost,2009,"I must have been sleeping
I must have been drinking
I haven't been dreaming about you for years
There was a sharp turn and a sunburn
I was too cool for high school that year
It must have been New Years
No one invited you
You took things too far
But I missed you
And your antics
You were lonesome
And blue eyed
And so special to us
You should have taken a long break
Instead of a long drop from a high place
Ten years I never spoke your name
Now it feels good to say it
You're my friend again
He said he forgave you
I said I hated you
He was the bigger man
I was sixteen
All the innocence
It took for
You to finally make your year book
That year
That year
You could have taken some time away
Instead of a long drop
Instead of a leap of faith
Ten years I never spoke your name
Now it feels good to say that
You're my friend again
You're my friend again
I was angry
I was a Baptist
I was a daughter
I was wrong"
Brandi Carlile,Before It Breaks,Give Up The Ghost,2009,"Around here, it's the hardest time of year
Waking up, the days are even gone
The collar of my coat
Lord help me, cannot help the cold
The raindrops sting my eyes
I keep them closed
But I'm feelin' no pain
Only the lonely and my quietest friend
Have I the moonlight? Have I let you in?
Say it ain't so, say I'm happy again
Say it's over, say I'm dreaming
Say I'm better than you left me
Say you're sorry, I can take it
Say you'll wait, say you won't
Say you love me, say you don't
I can make my own mistakes
Let it bend before it breaks
I'm all right. Don't I always seem to be?
Aren't I swinging on the stars?
Don't I wear them on my sleeve?
When you're looking for a crossroads
It happens every day
And whichever way you turn
I'm gonna turn the other way
Say it's over, say I'm dreaming
Say I'm better than you left me
Say you're sorry, I can take it
Say you'll wait, say you won't
Say you love me, say you don't
I can make my own mistakes
Learn to let it bend before it breaks
Say it's over say I'm dreaming
Say I'm better than you left me
Say you're sorry, I can take it
Say you'll wait, say you won't
Say you love me, say you don't
I can make my own mistakes
Let it bend before it breaks"
Brandi Carlile,Again Today,The Story,2007,"Broken sticks and broken stones
Will turn to dust just like our bones
It's words that hurt the most now isn't it
Are you sad inside, are you home alone
If I could just pick up the phone
Maybe you could see a better day
And you won't waste away
Under my watchful eye
Because I'm your hero and you're my weakness
Who's gonna break my fall
When the spinning starts
The colors bleed together and fade
Was it ever there at all
Or have I lost my way
The path of least resistance
Is catching up with me again today
I'm broken down, not good enough
The broken promises add up
To twice their weight in tears which I have caused
I'm afraid to sink, I'm afraid to swim
I'm sad to say I miss my friends
I know that I'm supposed to step away
But they need me to stay and keep a watchful eye
On all my heroes and all their demons
But who's gonna break my fall
When the spinning starts
The colors bleed together and fade
Was it ever there at all
Or have I lost my way
The path of least resistance
Is catching up with me again
Not today
Not today
Was it ever there at all
And have I lost my way
The path of least resistance
Is catching up with me again today
Broken sticks and broken stones
Will turn to dust just like our bones again today
I'm broken down
Not good enough
The broken promises add up again today
Was it ever there at all
And have I lost my way
The path of least resistance
Is catching up with me again today
Again today"
Brandi Carlile,The Things I Regret,The Firewatcher’s Daughter,2015,"Ohhhhh ohhhh ohhhh oh-o-oh
Ohhhhh ohhhh ohhhh oh-o-oh

There's a hole in my pocket where my dreams fell through
From a side walk in the city to the avenue
There's a leak in my dam 'bout the size of a pin
And I can't quite remember where the water's getting in
But when you're wearing on your sleeve
All the things you regret
You can only remember what you want to forget
You feel it tugging at your heart
Like the stars overhead
'til you rest your bones on the killing bed

Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
When I doubt you
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
When I doubt you

With the weight of the world resting on my back
And the road on which I've travelled is as long as it is cracked
But I keep pressing forward with my feet to the ground
For a heart that is broken makes a beautiful sound
But when you're wearing on your sleeve
All the things you regret
You can only remember what you want to forget

Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
When I doubt you
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
When I doubt you

Ohhh ohhhh ohhh oh-o-oh
Ohhh ohhhh ohhh oh-o-oh

I walk through my days like a ghost in a dream
But the feel carries on and my past follows me
It's hard moving on from the things you done wrong
When they play in your head like an old fashioned song
But when you're wearing on your sleeve
All the things you regret
You can only remember what you want to forget

Lonely miles, without you
Lonely miles, without you
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
When I doubt you

Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
When I doubt you
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
Let the ground keep my faults
Let the water be my home
Let the dust hold my soul
Like a holy rolling stone"
Brandi Carlile,Josephine,The Story,2007,"Take me back Josephine
To that cold and dark December
I am missing someone but I don't know who
Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you
Noontime wind can you blow
For me one more time
And take me on back to the start
Where the midnight moon shines so bright
Nearly pulled us up to Heaven
By the strings of our heart
Take me back Josephine
To that cold and dark December
I am missing someone but I don't know who
Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you
Morning sun shine on me
Come light inside my window
And rest on my brow
Kiss my eyes when I sleep
And carry me back home
If my dreams will allow
Take me back Josephine
To that cold and dark December
I am missing someone but I don't know who
Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you
Take me back Josephine
To that cold and dark December
I am missing someone but I don't know who
Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you
Someone help me understand why I'm still loving you"
Brandi Carlile,Wherever Is Your Heart,The Firewatcher’s Daughter,2015,"I think it's time we found a way back home
You lose so many things you love as you grow
I missed the days when I was just a kid
My fear became my shadow, I swear it did

Wherever is your heart I call home
Wherever is your heart I call home
Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
Wherever is your heart I call home

You made me feel like I was always falling
Always falling down without a place to land
Somewhere in the distance I heard you calling
Oh it hurts so bad to let go of your hand


Even when you're high, you can get low
Even with your friends you love, you're still alone
We always find the darkest place to go
God forgive our minds, we were born to roam


Oh God forgive my mind, oh God forgive my mind
When I come home, when I come home
Oh God forgive my mind
There's a road that's long and winding, it hollers home
I'm calling home
Oh God forgive my mind, oh God forgive my mind
When I come home, when I come home
Oh God forgive my mind, oh God forgive my mind
When I come home, when I come home

Brandi Carlile,What Can I Say,Brandi Carlile,2005,"Look to the clock on the wall
Hands hardly moving at all
I can't stand the state that I'm in
Sometimes it feels like the walls closing in
Oh, Lord, what can I say
I'm so sad since you went away
Time, time, ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be
Lord, what can I say
Try to burn my troubles away
Drown my sorrow the same way
Seems no matter how hard I try
Feels like there's something just missing inside
Oh, Lord, what can I say
I'm so sad since you went away
Time, time, ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be
Lord, what can I say
Oh, Lord, what can I say
How many rules can I break
How many lies can I make
How many roads must I turn
To find me a place where the bridge hasn't burned
Oh, Lord, what can I say
I'm so sad since you went away
Time, time, ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be
Lord, what can I say
Oh, Lord, what can I say"
Brandi Carlile,Dreams,Give Up The Ghost,2009,"Dreams, I have dreams
When I'm awake when I'm asleep
And you, you are in my dreams
You're underneath my skin
How am I so weak
And now in my dreams
I can feel the way, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
How long, can you hold your breath?
Can you count to ten, can you let it pass?
Keep, can you keep it in?
Keep it behind latches, can you make it last?
And now in my dreams
I can feel the way, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
Oh, and I have dreams, I have dreams
Mind, can you read my mind?
Has it come undone, am I showing signs?
And now, in my dreams
I can feel the way, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
I have dreams, I have, I have, I have dreams"
Brandi Carlile,I Will,Give Up The Ghost,2009,"It's not the end of the world, it's not even over
But it will be soon. I never learned my lessons
I just changed my tune and no one seems to notice
But you will, you will
It's no big deal
But the last thing I think of when I close my eyes
And the first thing on my mind when I arise:
It is a day and you're not really in my life
You can try and you won't find it where you're looking
You can hold it till it's putty in your hands
And you can't break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You can never be there for me in the end
And I will do the right thing. I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
You're not fooling me
I'm not the sort of girl who can't see reason
But it's nothing that a little bit of time won't heal
I know it don't come easy but I love you, I do
Coming clean
Means never closing curtains, I just changed my scene
Oh but you know what I mean, and I will learn throughout my life
To never lean on what will bend
I can try and I won't find it where I'm looking
I can hold it till it's putty in my hands
You can't break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You could never be there for me in the end
But I will do the right thing. I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I don't think you ever learned a thing from me
But I'm sure that you want me to learn from you
And you've drawn heavy-handed lines around morality
About yourself, and I don't share your point of view
It's been time to let you go a thousand times, you'd never know
That it hurts to be the one that you'd regret
I have to say that I'm proud to know you
And I'll never be the same because we met
You might not miss this. And I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will"
Brandi Carlile,My Song,The Story,2007,"Everything I do
Surrounds these pieces of my life
That often change
Or maybe I've changed
Sometimes seeming happy
Can be self-destructive
Even when you're sane
Or only insane
But don't bother waking me today
Here I am
I'm so young
I know I've been bitter
I've been jaded
I'm alone
Everyday, I bite my tongue
If you only knew
My mind was full of razors
To cut you like a
Word if only sung
But this is my song
It is my song
Now I live everyday
Like there'll never be a last one
Till they're gone
And they're gone
I'm not too proud to beg for
Your attention and your friendship
And your time
So you can come and get it from now on
Here I am
I'm so young
I know I've been bitter
I've been jaded
I'm alone
Everyday, I bite my tongue
If you only knew
My mind was full of razors
To cut you like a
Word if only sung
This is my song
It's my song
And it's you
It is you
Here I am
I'm so young
I know I've been bitter
I've been jaded
I'm alone
Everyday, I bite my tongue
If you only knew
My mind was full of razors
I'm not sure I can take it
I've nothing strong to hold to
I'm way too old to hate you
My mind is full of razors
To cut you like a
Word if only sung
But this is my song"
Brandi Carlile,The Heartache Can Wait,The Hotel Café Presents: Winter Songs,2008,"You're talking about leaving, it's right about Christmas time
Thinking about moving on, I think I might die inside
I'm thinking about years gone by
I'm thinking about church at midnight
I'm thinking about letting go
I think that might finally be alright
But this is where we shine

Silver bells and open fire and songs we used to sing
One more chance to be inspired is what I'm offering
If love is not enough
Then stay with me because the heartache can wait

It's not about hanging on, it's making my deal with God
If I could call one last truce, we've given it all we've got
Then I'm gonna catch my breath and make it a long December
If we've got nothing left, this could be worth remembering
With a smile upon my face

Silver bells and open fire and songs we used to sing
One more chance to be inspired is what I'm offering
If love is not enough
Then stay with me because
Silver bells and open fire and songs we used to sing
One more chance to be inspired is what I'm offering
If love is not enough
Then stay with me because the heartache can wait"
Brandi Carlile,Pride and Joy,Give Up The Ghost,2009,"Time of day I can't recall
The kind of thing that takes its toll
Over years and over time
Over smiles and over wine
All in all it wasn't bad
All in all it wasn't good
But I still care
That's the problem with the days
They're never long enough to say
What it is you never said
All the books you never read
I throw myself into the wind
Hoping somebody might pick me up
And carry me again
Where are you now?
Do you let me down?
Do you make me grieve for you?
Do I make you proud?
Do you get me now?
Am I your pride and joy?
I believe this to be true
There’s nothing sacred, nothing new
No one tells you when its time
There are no warnings, only signs
Then you know that you're alone
You're not a child anymore
But you're still scared
All your mountains turn to rocks
All your oceans turn to drops
They are nothing like you thought;
You can't be something you are not
Life is not a looking glass
Don't get tangled in your past
Like I am learning not to
Where are you now?
Do you let me down?
Do you make me grieve for you?
Do I make you proud?
Do you get me now?
Am I your pride and joy?"
Brandi Carlile,If There Was No You,Give Up The Ghost,2009,"When I see myself I'm seeing you too
As long as I remember and I'm feeling like I knew
That my jokes aren't funny the truth isn't true
If there was no you
If you were my boat in the deep blue sea
I probably sink you down
I know I should have thanked you for carrying me
But for you I would happily drown
Out on your way the darkest night the longest day
I know what to say to make you laugh
And nothing you could do
Could make me turn my back on you
When you're looking for a fight I'm your man
When you need a friend you got my hand
And what I really mean what I'm trying hard to say
Is that I'm counting on you and you got me too
Our secrets aren't safe I'm singing out of tune
If there was no you, if there was no you
Out on your way darkest night the longest day
I know what to say to make you laugh
And nothing you could do
Could make me turn my back on you

When you need a friend you got my hand
You got my hand"

Like a wounded cannonball
Sinking down with my heart in tow
Bright lights like white lightning
Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
How I'm lost
How I'm found
There's a man all alone
Telling me his friends are gone
That they've died and flown away
So I told him he was wrong
That your friends are never gone
If you look to the sky and pray
Bright lights like white lightning
Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
How I'm lost
How I'm found
Someone told me a lie
Someone looked me in the eye
And said time will ease your pain
But behold, when you fall
It's that same old cannonball
Coming back for your heart again
Bright lights like white lightning
Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
And it may come around
Until the day comes around

Watching fires burn from smoke to black
There's nothing she won't burn, from styrofoam to urns
To someone else's ashes in a sack
You can scorch the metal, you can even melt the glass
You can pass the time here, fire lives into the past
An all-consuming flame that refines and new begins
It'll take your family heirlooms, but it can take your darkest sins

It's a good ol' bedtime story, give you nightmares 'til you die
And the ones who love to tell 'em hide the mischief in their eyes
Condemn their sons to Hades and Gehenna is full of guys, alive and well
But there ain't no hell for a firewatcher's daughter
We exorcize the demons of the things we used to know
The gnashing of the teeth become the remnants of our homes
We think we're moving on, from materials we long
To forget we ever sold our souls to own
There's a chilling absolution that we're given at our birth
A powerful delusion and a plague upon the earth
But nothing scares me more than the stranger at my door
Who I fail to give shelter, time, and worth

Yeah, the good ol' bedtime stories give you nightmares 'til you die

A day in June you came to me
I've seen through someone else's eyes
With nothin' on the other side
Every motel, every town
Pieces scattered all around
Promises that I can't be
Someone's heart that I can't keep
Days so long I couldn't speak
Roads so rocky I can't sleep
But I've seen things so beautiful
All around this broken world
That pale in comparison to you

Can't imagine what I'm goin' through
Without you by my side

I hope you will remember me
You're always on my mind

I have seen the canyon lands
Crooked lines like in your hands
You'd swear the earth was split in two
I wouldn't lie I promise you
That I have seen it, you will too
You could not believe if not for
Photographs I took for you, Caroline
They've built towers to the sky
It hurts sometimes to watch them try
They run themselves into the ground
But I know you will love them
And their city lights and city sounds
There's beauty in the struggle
Anytime I feel it get me down
I see you smiling

And when the sun goes down
The shadow on the wall
It cannot be seen at all
At all
Over it
Hey it's not that you would mess with my head
I believe that you believe what you said
You think you know me best and you care
But that's not fair!
Cause I don't really want to be safe
It must have been the way I was raised
Sleep with one eye open I say
Hey hey hey
I don't wanna be
Nobody's fool
I've played that part so many times before
How I long to be
A shadow on the wall
I will make no sound at all
And when the sun goes down
The shadow on the wall
It cannot be seen at all
At all
Oh
How long to be
A shadow on the wall
I would make no sound at all
At all"
Brandi Carlile,Have You Ever,The Story,2007,"Have you ever wandered lonely through the wood?
And everything it feels just as it should
You're part of the life there, part of something good
If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods
Ooooh
If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods
Have you ever stared into a starry sky?
Lyin on your back you're askin' why?
What's the purpose, I wonder who am I
If you've ever stared into a starry sky
Ooooh, aaaah, aaooaaooh
Have you ever stared into a starry sky
Have you ever been out walking in the snow
Tried to get back where you were before
You always end up not knowing where to go
If you've ever been out walking in the snow
Ooooh, aaaah, aaooaaooh, ooooh, aaooaaooh
If you'd ever been out walking, you would know"
Brandi Carlile,Wasted,The Story,2007,"If you had eyes like golden crowns
And diamonds in your fingertips
You'd waste it
If shining wisdom passed your lips
And traveled to the ears of God
You'd waste it
And so I hate that you're overrated
Most revered and celebrated
Bcause you'll waste it
Then again
It's good to get a call
Now and then
Just to say hello
Have I said
I hate to see you go
I hate to see you go
But every time you close a door
And nothing opens in its place
You've wasted
And when you speak the words you know
To those who know the words themselves
You're wasted
You're such a classic waste of cool
So afraid to break the rules
In all the wrong places
But then again
It's good to get a call
Now and then
Just to say hello
Have I said
Oh I hate to see you go
I hate to see you go
But then again
It's good to get a call
Now and then
Just to say hello
Have I said
I hate to see you go
I hate to see you go
Singing doo doo do roo doo doo
Singing doo doo do roo doo doo"
Brandi Carlile,Late Morning Lullaby,The Story,2007,"As soon as my eyes shut the slide show begins
Yesterday is gone now and panic sets in
With a weight upon my chest
And a ghost upon my back
And the numbing sensation of everything
I lack that leaves me
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Your real world away
And beautiful, o beautiful bright eyes, lie
Only beautiful, o beautiful bright eyes cry
Singing late morning lullaby
The first sign of morning is gray and alarming
It's so disappointing the day has come so soon
While the rest of the world greets the day and feels new
I will push it away just like I always do, I will be
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Your real world away
And beautiful, o beautiful bright eyes, lie
Only beautiful, o beautiful bright eyes cry
Singing late morning lullaby
Late morning lullaby
I would darken my window so I can fall asleep
While the critics frown down on the hours
I keep that leave me
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Your real world away"
Brandi Carlile,A Promise to Keep,Bear Creek,2012,"I still talk to you in my sleep
I don't say much 'cause the hurt runs too deep
I gave you the moon and the stars to keep
But you gave them back to me
The hill I'm walkin up is gettin good and steep
But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I still lay on my side of the bed
I dance alone when the last bottle's spent
Memories like a river runnin' through my head
I'll have me an ocean before I'm dead
The hill I'm walkin up is gettin good and steep
But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I still whisper sweet words to you
And when I'm busy, or have nothing to do
I pray to god, that my words ring true
And that your words might reach me too
The hill I'm walkin up is gettin good and steep
But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I can't keep it...
My hearts in pieces so please understand
I'm trying  to jump, but I've nowhere to land
So give me your heart and I'll give you my hand
And I'll try as goddamn hard as I can
The hill I'm walkin up is gettin good and steep
But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep"
Brandi Carlile,Looking Out,Give Up The Ghost,2009,"I went out looking for the answers and never left my town
I'm no good at understanding, but I'm good at standing ground
And when I asked a corner preacher I couldn't hear him for my
Youth. Some people get religion some people get the truth. I
Never get the truth, I never get the truth
I know the darkness pulls on you. And it's just a point of view
When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when
You feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like your
Heart can break in two, someone loves you
I lay this suitcase on my chest so I can feel somebody's weight
And I lay you to rest just to feel a give and take?
I got a new interpretation and it's a better point of view, you
Were looking for a landslide I was looking out for you, I was
Looking out for you, someone's looking out for you
I know the darkness pulls on you. And it's just a point of view
When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when
You feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like your
Heart can break in two, someone loves you
I am afraid of crossing lines. I am afraid of flying blind
Afraid of inquiring minds. Afraid of being left behind
I close my eyes I think of you, I take a step I think of you
I catch my breath I think of you, I cannot rest I think of you
My one and only wrecking ball, and you're crashing through my
Walls. When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and
When you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like
Your heart could break in two, someone loves you"
Brandi Carlile,Save Part of Yourself,Bear Creek,2012,"The sun came up and five years gone
Life goes on, yeah, life goes on
I wonder how you're gettin' by
The sun goes down and I feel blue
Now I toss 'cause my mind's on you
And I kind of miss your broken smile
Save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me?
I remember you and me
Lost and young and dumb and free
And unaware of years to come
Just a whisper in the dark
On the pavement in the park
You taught me how to love someone
So save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me?
When we walk into the sun
Or burn below for what we've done
Will you still call out for me?
Turn to light or fade to black
You don't look back, no, you don't look back
At what you might not wanna see
But save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me?
The sun goes down and five years gone
Life goes on, yes, life goes on
I hope you caught up with your dreams
I hope you saved part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me?
Save part of yourself for me"
Brandi Carlile,Keep Your Heart Young,Bear Creek,2012,"My grandpa gave me a wheat penny and I kept it in my pocket
Had big plans in my backyard to build me a space rocket
Talked to my brother on a fake CB that I made from a tic-tac box
Packed my snowballs nice and tight and in the middle I put rocks
Don't trade in your tic-tac box for a ball on the end of the chain
And don't go spending grandpa's pennies buying into the game
You gotta keep your heart young
Don't go growin' old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young
Dad took the wheels off of my bike and he pushed me down a hill
But speed got the best of me and I took my first spill
That was back when alcohol was only used on cuts
Stung like hell so I jerked my leg and mama said it would give me guts
Don't trade in your tic-tac box for a ball on the end of the chain
And don't go spending grandpa's pennies buying into the game
You gotta keep your heart young
Don't go growing old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young
So take a picture of the one you love and put it in a locket
Go dig up your time capsule and the blueprints for your rocket
Keep in touch on a fake CB and that same old tic-tac box
Pack your snowballs a little less tight but in the middle: still put rocks
And keep your heart young
Don't go growing old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young
You gotta keep your heart young
Sometimes you don't die quick
Just like you wished you'd done
Though love is a loaded gun
You've gotta keep your heart young
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young"
Brandi Carlile,Dying Day,Give Up The Ghost,2009,"I left home a long long time ago
In a tin can for the road
With a suitcase and some songs
Chasing miles through the night time
Making tracks with no time for looking back
To the place where I belong
How these days grow long
But I'm on my way back home
It's been hard to be away
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you till my dying day
How these days grow long
When you're sad you know I wish I could be there
To make your sorrows disappear
And set your troubles free
It's not fair for me to be this far from you
But I promise to stay true, wherever I might be
Time keeps burning
The wheels keep on turning
Sometimes I feel I'm wasting my days
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you till my dying day
How these days grow long
Time keeps burning on
How these days grow long
Now I'm lost in a sea of sunken dreams
While the sound of drunken screams echos in the night
But I know all of this will come to pass
And I'll be with you at last forever by your side
How these days grow long
But I'm on my way back home
It's been hard to be away
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you till my dying day
Time keeps burning
The wheels keep on turning
Sometimes I feel I'm wasting my days
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you till my dying day
How these days grow long
Time keeps burning on
How these days grow long"
Brandi Carlile,Oh Dear,Give Up The Ghost,2009,"Oh dear out here
Everybody stumbles on fear
Who cares if we’re scared
Everyone is on their own
It’s only you that my heart desires
Only you alone can know my pain
All alone you were sitting there
Folding pages for your paper chain
Now you can cut me free (now you can cut me free)
Forever say goodbye (forever say goodbye)
Or well be holding hands and go on
Together you and I forever
Heart breaks mistakes
Catching up to me in old ways
I know of hard days
Had my share of lonely nights
Its only you that my heart desires
Only you alone can break my fall
I pace the floor and I wish for more
While you were dreaming with your paper dolls
Now you can cut me free (now you can cut me free)
So when it all unfolds (so when it all unfolds)
We’ll be holding hands and go on
Together you and I forever
Poor dear out here
Everybody stumbles on fear
Who cares if you’re scared
Everyone is on their own
Oh dear"
Brandi Carlile,Hiding My Heart Away,,0,"This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
That blew me away
It blew me away
It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away
And buried them away
I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappeared one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
You drive me off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of my head
And watch me wave
And watch me wave
Then you went on home to your skyscrapers
Neon lights and waiting papers
That you call home
I call it home
I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappeared one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away
I woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain
The morning rein
And although I wished that you were near
That same old road that brought me here
Is calling me home
Is calling me home
I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappeared one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
And I could spend my whole life hiding my heart away"
Brandi Carlile,Downpour,The Story,2007,"I'm like the rain in a downpour
I wash away what you long for
And I wave goodbye with the sun in my eyes
I wish I could be there tonight
I'm like the wind in the canyon
I'm there then I'm gone in a second
You're growing older in peace where you're at
I wish I could be there for that
But I've moved on
Like a rolling stone
In a crowded room
I'm alone
I'm like the rain in a downpour
I wash away what you long for
And I wave goodbye with the sun in my eyes
I wish I could be there tonight
Oh, oh, yeah
You're like the tide in the deep blue
Cause you're always there when I need you
And when you need someone to carry you through
I'm gonna be there for you
I'm gonna be there for you"
Brandi Carlile,Wilder (We’re Chained),The Firewatcher’s Daughter,2015,"You came into this world with eyes as clear as water
You didn't look a thing like your grandmother's daughter
With a heart so heavy and beating like a drum
Yeah, neither did you look like your grandfather's son

We're chained
And when everything changes our love will stay the same
We're chained
And when everything else goes away, our love will still remain
We're chained

Wilder than a brushfire burns deep inside the bramble
Baby, I think God made your soul born to ramble
Maybe you'll take to the far away places
Where life is gonna deal you a hand full of aces
But it doesn't really matter how great the spaces


Life has a fuse and it burns with quickness
But death ain't the long twisted branch of sickness
Just as the spark gives birth to a flame
We'll be bound by our love and then the family name"
Brandi Carlile,I’ll Still Be There,Bear Creek,2012,"There never was a better love
To see the light of day
If only just to lift you up
And rise above the grey
It breaks my heart, but now you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I’ll still be there
My growing pain, my darkest days
I owe them all to you
For every break I've got you to thank
For always pulling me through
If it breaks your heart, at least you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I’ll still be there
But if the world should let you down
And the sky should fall and never make a sound
And if it all disappear
I promise you I will be there
It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart
But now you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there
But if the world should let you down
If the sky should fall and never make a sound
Oh if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there
And if it all disappears
You have my word I will be there
And if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there"
Brandi Carlile,Beginning To Feel The Years,The Firewatcher’s Daughter,2015,"You carry me along with you
Keep my spirit strong you do
Maybe I was meant to be
Under your lock and key
The hard times that I had
Really don't seem all that bad
Yesterday is long ago and far away

And I'm beginning to feel the years
But I'm going to be okay
As long as you're beside me--along the way
Gonna make it through the night
And into the morning light

There are things that I've said before
I don't mean them anymore
Yesterday is long ago and far away

And I'm beginning to feel the years
But I'm going to be okay
As long as you're beside me--along the way
Gonna make it through the night
And into the morning light

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo

With angels by your side
The spirit's there to guide

As long as you're beside me along the way
Gonna make it through the night

Brandi Carlile,Tragedy,Brandi Carlile,2005,"Sorry, I'm only
Human, you know me
Grown up, oh no guess again
My days always
Dry up and blow away
Sometimes I could do that too
But make no mistake that
When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as the end
Progress and changing
Growing then giving up
Somehow, I'm never quite prepared
But I understand that
When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as the end
So taking you with me would be like
Taking all your money to the grave
It does no good to anyone especially
The one you're trying to save
It's so hard not to say
When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as the end"
Brandi Carlile,Closer To You,Brandi Carlile,2005,"It's hard to let the miles pass me by
Yellow lines they blend together in my eyes
And when the seasons change again then I will too
But I just wanna be closer to you
And I'm staring out at endless rows of green
There are miles of hay like I've never seen
But just when you think you've had enough and your dreams come true
I just wanna be closer to you
Oh my mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doing something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Tomorrow I'll be lying under you
With a heart of gold and arms to fall into
I know that there might come a day my life is through
But I just wanna be closer to you
Oh my mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doing something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Someday we might learn to tell the truth
We might even find the fountains of our youth
And we all needed something real we all need proof
But I just wanna be closer to you
I only wanna be closer to you"
Brandi Carlile,Heroes and Songs,The Firewatcher’s Daughter,2015,"Some rights and some wrongs
Some heroes and songs
Are much better left unsolved
Between fiction and fact
Illusion and pact
Where we've been into what we've become
Although we have changed
We're never estranged
And there's nothing I'd trade from before
I love you my friend - my dear means to an end
But you're not in my dreams anymore
I'll never ally
All the voices goodbye
To the magical mystery tour
Keep the tears that I cried
In my youth and my pride
And the sorrow like never before
I've got thank you's and smiles
And affection for miles
And I always will look unto you
You held open the door
For who I'm sent here for
To come in and make my dreams come true
Although it was sad
And it hurt 'cause it had to
There's nothing I'd change from before
I love you my friend - my dear means to an end
But you're not in my dreams anymore
Although it was sad
And it hurt really bad
There's nothing I'd change from before
I love you my friend - my dear means to an end
But you're not in my dreams anymore
You're not in my dreams anymore"
Brandi Carlile,Happy,Brandi Carlile,2005,"I don't hang around that place no more
I'm tired of wearing circles in the floor
And I don't carry myself very well
But I've gotten so much braver, can you tell
I'm happy, can't you see
I'm alright, but I miss you, Amber Lee
And I line my secrets up all one by one
I put 'em all away when I was done
And I would really love to hear your voice sometime
To close a little distance in my mind
I'm happy, can't you see
I'm alright, but I miss you, Amber Lee
I believe
Where have you been all these years
How could you just disappear
And when did you stop missing me
I'm happy, can't you see
I'm alright, but I miss you, Amber Lee
I'm alright, but I miss you, Amber Lee"
Brandi Carlile,100,Bear Creek,2012,"When I'm blowin out the candles
And when people start to sing
I will always cross my fingers tight
I remember everything
But I always make my wishes
For the same thing everytime
If I live to be one hundred
If I ever get it right
My mind is racing with thoughts
And the songs that never end
And I prayed to God last night
Just before I went to bed
Even now I can't remember
A single word He said
If I live to be one hundred
If I get it through my head
I always think about you
And I have to close my eyes
If I live to be one hundred
Will I ever cross your mind
When you close your eyes at night
And you rise above your life
Do you notice there, an empty space
Where I wasn't by your side
Because I always dream about you
Every time I close my eyes
If I live to be one hundred
Will I ever cross your mind
I always make my wishes
For same thing every time
If I live to be one hundred
Will I ever cross your mind"
Brandi Carlile,Fall Apart Again,Brandi Carlile,2005,"Long is the day, take it away
Hold it up and you don't let it fall
Cause devil's play was yesterday
And I don't care about that at all
I just smile, once in a while
Cause I don't want the lines on my face
And I sit right here, holding the years
And I count all the stars in space
You fall apart again, and you can find a friend
Don't turn to someone else, cause they won't understand
Self-respect goes unexpressed
I don't dream cause I cannot sleep
And I think the world of myself
But the world doesn't think much of me
As long as the day is full of time
There will always be room for your hand in mind
You fall apart again, and you can find a friend
Don't turn to someone else, cause they won't understand
I don't wanna hear you say that you miss yesterday
If you don't like what you see, that means nothing to me
No one's home, I'm alone with my music and my defeat
And I still say that yesterday is best when left to sleep
You fall apart again, and you can find a friend
Don't turn to someone else, cause they won't understand
I don't wanna hear you say that you miss yesterday
If you don't like what you see, that means nothing to me"
Brandi Carlile,Cowgirls,,0,"To be fair I should've told you
Running from the money is what I do
I don't believe in wealth and excess
And I have had debt the size of Texas
But I, I didn't follow my dreams
To dump my money in your slot machine
And you can take that to the bank
Tell the bank man the devil said thanks
You know you can't get a drink in this town
Without Sunday morning comin' down
And cashing in on the costume
Yeah, get 'em while they last
The NRA can kiss my country ass

Just because you got a little dust under your boots
Doesn't mean you walked a country mile
You never hopped a train
And your back roads are going outta style
Listen to the radio and sing along
You're not saying anything
Well you never laid a railroad tie
Or watched a lonesome cowboy die
Or listened to the bells of freedom ring
And now that you're just spittin' in the wind
It's time for you to let them cowgirls in

You got your ten gallon hat
Yeah, your chewing cigars and you're smoking the fat
Tattoos of naked ladies
You played the same video games in the 80's
I hope your vintage guitar
Will take you where the wild things are
I hope you find your true voice again
And the ghost of who you are
And then they're gonna call you an outlaw
Live fast and die young
Those songs have already been sung by better men

Just because you got a little dust under your boots
Doesn't mean you walked a country mile
You never hopped a train
And your back roads are going outta style
Listen to the radio and sing along
You're not saying anything
Well you never laid a railroad tie
Or watched a lonesome cowboy die
Or listened to the bells of freedom ring
And now that you're just spittin' in the wind
It's time for you to let them cowgirls in

Now that you're just spittin' in the wind
It's time for you to let them cowgirls in"
Brandi Carlile,Blood Muscle Skin & Bone,The Firewatcher’s Daughter,2015,"You're still alive inside somewhere
Or are you just remains?
You're blood muscle skin and bone
So people cause you pain
But when the skies are crashing down
And when my days are dark and grey
When my fires are burning low
When the life inside me fades
I know that I can count on you
Because you never let me lie
You bring the truth back to me
You bring my back to life

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak

There's a place I call my home
Where the sun falls down on me
The light fills in the shadows there
And peace of mind is free
But far below that place
A tear forms in my eye
The shadows have no foe there
And darkness multiplies
I know that I can count on you
Because you've never led me astray
You bring the truth back to me now
You always light my way

Brandi Carlile,Throw It All Away,Brandi Carlile,2005,"When you're near me I have no fear
When I'm untrue you see right through me
You know me as deep as the sea goes
Calm my head whenever a storm blows
When the stars, and the moon
And the sky fall through
I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away, away
So in my restless hour I'm holding
Words you say that lay my soul to sleep
I dream of buildings that burn
The sky turns black, I toss and turn
When the stars, and the moon
And the sky fall through
I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away, away
This love branches out like an oak tree
Reach for the sky and roots to the sea
So when you're shaken down and broken
Find your peace of mind in knowing
I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away, away"

It used to be that everything was easy
Now it's lost and nobody believes me
Am I losing heart
Have I frozen it, oh yeah
Am I pushing too hard
Have I started to forget
I'm alright
Am I made of steel
Am I locked up tight
I'm human
But I'm wide awake and afraid to fight
It used to take nothing to amaze me
But now I'm older and
It doesn't even phase me
Am I losing heart
Have I frozen it, oh yeah
Am I pushing too hard
Have I started to forget
It used to be that everything was easy

Brandi Carlile,Touching the Ground,Give Up The Ghost,2009,"I swear when we touched I saw heaven in your eyes
Jewel studded clouds floating in your skies
Seas of blue and fields of green
Looking like you fell out of someone's dreams
Why do my troubles turn true
Whenever I rest my eyes on you
Why must my heartache be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
You could sing an army of angels to sleep
Songs that could cause the devil to weep
You hold me so sweet when the day is done
Enough to make you wonder where we all came from
Why do my troubles turn true
Whenever I rest my eyes on you
Why must my heartache be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
My heartache can be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
And out of those eyes I'm feeling rain
Bringing me misery and giving me pain
Curse these shackles that you put on me
Blessed be the day when you set me free
Why do my troubles turn true
Whenever I rest my eyes on you
Why must my heartache be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
My heartache can be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
My heartache can be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground"
Brandi Carlile,What Did I Ever Come Here For,Bear Creek,2012,"I’ve been gone for so long
And how I missed you
My heart was aching for home
And then one night as I lay down
Somewhere far from you
I dreamt that I heard you call my name
But my mind was playing games
I knew right then that I’d return
To where I was before
And I was so tired of being away
That I just couldn’t stay anymore
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?
I thought if I showed up in the night
In my best disguise
There at your doorway in your porch light
That you would look into my eyes
And you would realize who I am
Put your arms around me
You gonna love me so much more
Than you ever did before
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?
It wasn’t too long before
I showed up at your door
I’d been gone a thousand miles
I didn’t know how much more I could stand
If I could stand at all
You said I looked like I’d been through World War II
And my soul was worn right through
I thought you would read my mind
I thought you’d ask me to stay
You'd never turn me away like before
But you closed your door anyway
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?"
Brandi Carlile,Just Kids,Bear Creek,2012,"Were we just kids, just starting out
Didn't we know then love was about
Were we just fooling, playing around
Were we ever gonna get out of this town
Move to Seattle, stay up all night
That was when bedtime was our biggest fight
All in a moment, all in a sound
All in a day's work, we're tumbling down
Down by the old school, trash in the street
Searching the eyes of the strangers we meet
Asking will it get better?
Will we be alone?
Turning the wheels of our bicycles home
Over the rainbow, out in the snow
Learning to walk with the sand in our toes
Long to be tall, kissed when you fall
Hoping that someone will come when you call
You call, you call, you call
You call, you call, you call
You call, you call, you call
You call, you call, you call"
Brandi Carlile,Love Songs,,0,"I can never write a love song
I can never write a blue song
When I'm in love I am a lover
And I have always had the blues
I am afraid that no one sees me
What will they say when I am gone
It occurs to me I think I miss you
I think I've missed you all along
Out of the corner of my eye (out of the corner of my eye)
Not sure if I should think these things of you
Is it the wrong place at the wrong time
I think it's just my turn to lose
Thoughts of you could give me smile lines
I laugh myself to sleep because I knew (I knew)
We were talking ‘bout a fine line
It depends on who you're talking to
If it's any consolation
The blues have always had me too
And if I ever write a love song
I think I'll write it about you"
Brandi Carlile,In the Morrow,Bear Creek,2012,"I found myself today
I took my cross up and walked away
With amazing grace and open eyes
Even though I'm born to lose my way
Tomorrow comes on a hurricane
When the weight of the world is on your mind
In the morrow I'll be gone
I gave it everything I had for so long
Save your sorrow for your song
Don't we always find a way to carry on
No one sees it coming
And no one walks when they should've been running
Nothing hurts like knowing you tried
And we can see how years can slip away
In the cold dark nights and the long hard days
But nothing aches quite like goodbye
In the morrow I'll be gone
I gave it everything I had for so long
Save your sorrow for your song
Don't we always find a way to carry on
In the morrow I'll be gone
I gave it everything I had for so long
Save your sorrow for your song
Don't we always find a way
In the morrow I'll be gone
I gave it everything I had for so long
Save your sorrow for your song
Don't we always find a way to carry on
Don't we always find a way to carry on"
Brandi Carlile,Rise Again,Bear Creek,2012,"When I find the sweet hereafter
Put a blanket on my soul
Cast a shadow on my heart
Slide the chain across my door
Ever turning all the seasons
Ever fading all the days
And if there ever was a reason
I just haven't found a way
To fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Only to rise again
I was longing for the wind
When the trees begin to sway
But I never grow my wings
No, I never fly away
For the anchor of my love
To which my heart is bound
Is the iron for the cage
That keeps me on the ground
To fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Only to rise again
Now I'm dreaming to myself
With a tear behind my eye
For a shelter is my mind
In the quiet of the night
Ever turning all the seasons
Ever fading all the days
And if there ever was a reason
I just haven't found a way
To fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Only to rise again"
Brandi Carlile,Follow,Brandi Carlile,2005,"Follow your heart and see where it might take you
Don't let the world outside there break you
They know not who you are inside
They've never felt your hell
Don't ever let them crack
Hold out I know you feel it getting cold out
Without the blanket for your soul and
Before you know it you'll be frozen
And you have to see this through
There's no one here but you
I feel the rain coming down
It reminds me of who I used to be
But now that's nothing more
Than a memory
Don't go to sleep and cry because
Tomorrow if you let it, it will swallow
You up and none of this will matter
Anymore
I feel the rain coming down
It reminds me of who I used to be
But now that's nothing more
Than a memory...
Follow your heart and see where it might take you
Don't let the world outside there break you
They know not who you are inside
They've never felt your hell
Don't ever let them crack your shell"
Brandi Carlile,Someday Never Comes,Brandi Carlile,2005,"Dear Love, I'll miss you much
I'll miss your smile and I'll miss your touch
But I found a place where I can erase my past
Maybe someday when you're old and gray
When your hair falls out and your tattoos fade
You might see me standing, hand in hand
I have to go away
I've got no reason to stay here
You said someday you'll change
But even a fool will tell you
Someday never comes
You built your rooms, you built your walls
You kept me outside of it all
I got tired of you, what's a girl to do
Maybe someday if we stay this way
And you see my face in a different place
You'll remember when, you're gonna thank me then
I have to go away
I've got no reason to stay here
You said someday you'll change
But even a fool will tell you
Someday never comes"
Brandi Carlile,Alibi,The Firewatcher’s Daughter,2015,"I done some bad bad things
The kind you don't bring up at confession
Somewhere in my life, woah
I took the wrong direction
I swear on my soul
I didn't want to hurt no one
But I got no way to justify
The things I done

If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to atone for my sins
If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to the fall for where I've been
You done some bad bad things
The kind that don't bare to mention
Something inside you died
Now you need some ressurrection
If you don't want to go down
Just like the setting sun
You got to find a way to reconcile
The things you done

If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to the fall for where I've been
I swear some people in the world
They got no moral compass
I know the wicked ones
I feel them walk among us
The hangman begs for mercy
Only when his time has come
Because he got no way to
Rectify the things he done

I won't take the fall for where I've been
I won't take that fall for where I've been, no"
Brandi Carlile,Eye Of The Needle,Acoustic,0,"Twenty years of pushing pens
Of up the stairs and down again
Should've learned to style my hair
So I could never sleep at night
I've never mastered eating right
Distracted by the skin I wear
And I'm alive in here somewhere
Cause I can feel me twistin'
I'm so far beyond my years
So don't be fooled by today
Hey please, just believe in me
Don't lose your hope so easily
Because passing through the eye of a needle
Isn't as easy as it sounds
For those like me
Yeah yeah
Nothing short of miracles
Can save a small and dying world
That offers no apologies
To lay their hopes and dreams asleep
But pray the Lord their goal to keep
But I still got a soul in me
And old protects ability
And illusions of grandeur
I once was blind but now I see
They got everything for me but grace
Hey please, just believe in me
Don't lose hope so easily
Because passing through the eye of a needle
Isn't as easy as it sounds
For those like me
Yeah yeah
Yeah
And I'm alive in here somewhere
Cause I can feel me twistin'
I'm so far beyond my years
So don't be fooled by today
Hey please, just believe in me
Don't lose hope so easily

Brandi Carlile,One magic kiss,,0,"Rock a bye Baby
You won't be long
One magic kiss and a soft little song
Sleepy head eyes and a great big yawn

Good night

Rock a bye baby
Sweetest of dreams
And honeycombed hills and rivers of cream
Big daffodils and orange and green
And blue
Good night

Good night to all and to all good night
The stars have come out and the moon shining bright
I see you again at the first morning light

Good night

Brandi Carlile,In My Own Eyes,Brandi Carlile,2005,"Hold me down, lift me up
There's someone on the bedside waiting there for me
I hear my name, turn around
There's gotta be a downside, something I don't see
Around me, hide me
Dying in the light of the room
Blind side please
I don't really wanna be seen
In my own eyes
Something's wrong, awake all night
'Cause I can feel the dark side closing in on me
Do you see me as I see myself
I promise there's a downside, something you can't see
About me, hide me
Dying in the light of the room
Blind side please
I don't really wanna be seen
In my own eyes
Lost in translation, free to fall
One situation and lose it all
Hide me
Dying in the light of the room
Blind side please
I don't really wanna be seen...
I don't really wanna be seen
In my own eyes"
Brandi Carlile,Gone,Brandi Carlile,2005,"Life is too short to waste all your time
Running too quickly to the finish line
Time is a trap, it's ready and set
And the longer you live, the closer you get to being
Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then we forget
Oooooooooh...
There's no guarantee or promise of wealth
And you're only allowed so much time on the shelf
Time isn't money, it's only a lie
Because everything lost can be found but your time when you're
Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then we forget
Oooooooooh...
So live in doubt, live in fear
And you might live forever
Or live it up, and watch your back
And you might live for better
Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then we forget
Oooooooooh..."
Brandi Carlile,Us Again,,0,"Close your eyes and count to three
I'm gonna make you proud of me
Not today, but that's alright
We have got a long long time
I've got big plans and you do too
And we've got ways to make them true
When I get old and if I do
I'm gonna get there next to you
And you can count on me
And you can lean on me
And we can throw our dreams to the wind
They'll find us again
With a hand to hold the rail
Count the years that we've got left
We've got the world by the tail
Oh we just don't know it yet
But you can count on me
And you can lean on me
And we can throw our dreams to the wind
And you can count on me
And you can lean on me
And we can throw our dreams to the wind
They'll find us again
They'll find us again
They'll find us again"
Brandi Carlile,I didn’t,,0,"I've been down with a broken heart
Since the day I learned to speak
The devil gave me a crooked start
When he gave me crooked feet
But Gabriel don came to me
And kissed me in my sleep
And I'll be singing like and angel
Until I'm six feet deep
I found myself an omen
And I tattoed on a sign
I set my mind to wandering
And I walk a broken line
You have a mind to keep me quiet
And although you can try
Better men have hit their knees
And bigger men have died
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
You came upon a lightning strike
And eyes of bright clear blue
I took a tie from around my neck
And gave my heart to you
I sent my love accross the sea
And though I didn't cry
That voice will haunt my every dream
Until the day I die
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
I dug a hole inside my heart
To put you in your grave
At this point it was you and me
And mama didn't raise no slave
You took my face in both your hands
And looked me in the eye
And I went down with such a force
That in your grave I lay
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one's telling
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell"
Brandi Carlile,Way To You,,0,"Way back when, when the days were young
We had our fun
Never cared much about being cool
Or growing old to play the old fool
Part of your life you spend paying your dues
Walking the miles and singing the blues
If I'm born into a pair of ramblin' shoes
I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll take my wings with a heart that's true
And find the way to you
Part of your life you spend paying your dues
Walking the miles in your old man shoes
When I finally find the way to shake loose
I'll tell you what I'll do
Hang my worry on a golden noose
And find the way to you
When we're all old and withering sages
Talkin' 'bout what might have been
Like a missing line or torn out pages
We're gonna miss you then
Walking the miles, singing the blues
Learning to love what god gives to you
If he gave me rockets on the bottom of my shoes
I tell you what I'd do
I'd burn my sole where the sun was new
And find the way
The way to you"
Brandi Carlile,Fall,Room for Me,0,"There's a candle in the corner
It keeps reminding me of you
It's how you lit it on my birthday
Sometimes I miss the things you do
But then you'd turn on me if the wind blew
And you'd sting me with a glare
And your thirst was so insatiable
Just to quench it robbed me bare
I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees
Cross-legged by the fireplace
I play guitar while you read
My patience ran so thin with you
Always toying with my head
Some how it made you strangely gleeful
To see me longing for your touch
And I still fail to see the humor in my loving you so much
I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees
I said we're faced with the facts and it's a high price to pay
C'mon blue eyes that tell me you can't walk away
If there's nothing to lose then there's nothing to gain
C'mon stay here tonight don't drive home in the rain
And I fall on my knees
All my pride is in your hands
We're not so strong and we've mislaid our plans
I taste the shame and I'll take the blame
If it's my cross to bear
I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees"

And hop a bus down to the big city
Tuesday it looked like rain
And i was laughing all insane
And running through it anyway
Hot cup of coffee in my fingers
As the weekend they disappear
Bye bye
Wednesday's paper is all about the president
We've all seen better ways of our time spent
Thursday it was nothing but a compropmise
Changing with the tide is just my way of being wise
Naive notions that were childish
And my thoughts of a busy day
Maybe
You know i worked all day then the sun went down at five
I'll pass the hours away just to keep myself alive
Yeah i didn't miss you a bit but i just might want you tonight
I'll wake up Saturday morning and finally i'll be all right
Friday comes my song is on the radio
A long drive home and i'm listening to my indigo
Solitary sense it finally comes over me
I made it through another week
I know just where i want to be
Raindrops on the window wash away my Friday blues
You know i worked all day then the sun went down at five
I passed the hours away just to keep myself alive
Yeah i didn't miss yo a bit but i just might want you tonight
I'll wake up Saturday morning and finally i'll be all right
We're all right now
Yeah i didn't miss you a bit but i just might want you tonight
I'll wake up Saturday morning and finally i'll be there

Tuesday it's raining in the big city
Wednesday's the president Thursday i pay the rent
Friday comes my song is on the radio

And days go by

You want to still be friends
It doesn't work that way

When the storm came in and the bottom fell out
Still I try I wonder why I can't figure it out
Floating on your silver cloud
If time wasn't lost
And the friends you forgot
That tried to be there for you
All you wanted was to be alone
And I can't win
It's over either way
Hey I know how this ends and I don't want to play
I was floating on your silver cloud
When the storm came in and the bottom fell out
Still I try I wonder why I can't figure it out
Floating on your silver cloud
I watched our friendship sink
I held out my hand
You tore another chink
And I didn't understand
Thru all the white lies
Thru all the black lies
Hard to survive

It's like the harder you try the bigger the debt you pay
I must have lost it...somewhere along the way
I never meant to cause you so much friction
I never saw how jaded I'd become
I never meant to harbor some addiction

Here on my shoulder in stone
I can never throw  away
And I'm so angry yet so sad
I remember when
You're so rad you're so rad
I never amount to nothing but
But ashes of faith

Tie your mother down, yeah, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight

Give me every inch of your love
All your love tonight, yeah
All your love
Tonight"
Brandi Carlile,Temporary Time,Open Doors,0,"I'm never gonna go that far
I'm never gonna try that hard
Well I don't wanna shake your hand
And I'm not gonna be your friend
You're never gonna see me cry
And someone said the reason why
I can never find the words to say
Send me on my way again
Not again
You're just out of reach how you come is how you leave
Temporary time is on your side
Yeah it's on your side
Well c'mon could you take me on
I just wanna come along
I'm never gonna be that cool
Breaking all my rules
Again not again
You're a sidewinder aren't you I can tell
Cold lonely stranger very well
But there's a cold line of distance in the way you stare across a room
And there's a cold line of distance in the way you shook my hand
You're a sidewinder aren't you I can tell
Cold lonely stranger very well
But there's a cold line of distance in the way you stare across a room
And there's a cold line of distance in the way you shook my hand"
